## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main parts:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React frontend application, including components, services, and styles.
- `python_ai_service/`: Contains the Flask-based Python backend for the AI recommendation engine.
- `public/`: Contains the files for the Chrome Extension as well as static assets like fonts and images.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.9 or later recommended) and `pip`

### 1. Frontend Setup

First, navigate to the project root and set up the React application.

```bash
# Install all the required npm packages
npm install

# Run the frontend development server
npm run dev
```
The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

### 2. Backend Setup

Next, set up and run the Python backend service in a separate terminal.

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd python_ai_service

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Flask server
python run.py
```
The backend API will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Chrome Extension Setup

To use the companion extension:

1.  Run the extension-specific build command:
    ```bash
    npm run build:extension
    ```
2.  Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3.  Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4.  Click "Load unpacked" and select the `public` directory that was generated in the project root.
5.  The Styaile.io extension should now be active in your browser.
